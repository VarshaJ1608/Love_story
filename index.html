        <p><b>❤️Beach Walk</b><br>
        That evening by the beach felt like a dream.
The waves were loud, but somehow everything felt peaceful when I was walking beside you.
Holding your hand, feeling the breeze, and talking about random things —
I wished that moment would never end..</p>
    </div>

      <div class="timeline-item center-item">
        <img src="images/photo5.jpg">
        <p><b>💬 First Ghibli Art</b><br>
        What a cute photo! Okay, I'll give it to you... you're definitely the cute one here.
We turned into characters from a Studio Ghibli movie,
but honestly…
our real story is even more beautiful.

That art wasn’t just cute —
it captured the softness, comfort, and warmth we share every day.</p>

        <p><b>🎁 Boat ride</b><br>
        That boat ride felt like we were floating in our own little world.
The water was calm, the breeze was soft, and you were sitting next to me —
and somehow, that was enough.

I didn’t need anything else in that moment.
Just you, the sound of water, and the quiet happiness in my heart.</p>

        <p><b>📷 First Trip</b><br>
        Our first trip together felt like freedom.
New place, new views —
but the best part was experiencing everything with you.

Every step we took, every picture we clicked,
every random laugh —
it all became a memory I’ll hold close forever.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="timeline-item wide">

        <p><b>🌸 Favorite Memory</b><br>
        It’s hard to choose just one moment,
because every second with you feels special.

But my favorite memory isn’t a big event —
it’s the simple moments.
The way you look at me,
the way we laugh at nothing,
and the way everything feels calm when you’re near.</p>

        <p>
            From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed in the most beautiful way.<br>
You didn’t just become my boyfriend… you became my peace, my happiness, and my safe place.<br><br>

Every conversation with you feels like home. Every laugh we share becomes my favorite memory.<br>
Even on difficult days, just thinking about you makes everything feel lighter.<br><br>

Thank you for loving me the way you do.<br>
Thank you for being patient with me, supporting me, and believing in me.<br>

I don’t know what the future holds…<br>
but I know I want you in every chapter of my life.<br><br>

You are not just my Valentine today.<br>
You are my always. ❤️<br>
